## Cunning Stunning Stunt Kite

In *zebra snooze*, you'll find the files you need to be able to generate a static sites and themes with Jekyll, then host on GitHub Pages.

To set up your environment to develop static sites and themes, you want a copy of this repo. Luckily, this is marked as a `Template` so you can simply [Use This Template][use-this] yourself without having to install any tools and dependencies via Terminal, that is Command Prompt on Windows. You will want to follow this generic pattern:

1. First, you will have to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already. [GitHub's Learning Lab][learning-lab] is a good source of information. Sign in to GitHub using your credentials, otherwise.
2. Next, [Use This Template][use-this] to create a copy of this repo, then follow the instructions. Read more about this in the [GitHub Template Repositories][template-repos] document.

That's it. You now have a *cunning stunning stunt kite*, and is ready to start working locally or on the cloud.
