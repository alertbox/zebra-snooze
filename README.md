## Cunning Stunning Stunt Kite

In *zebra snooze*, you'll find the files you need to be able to generate a static sites and themes with Jekyll, then host on GitHub Pages.

To set up your environment to develop static sites and themes, you want a copy of this repo. Luckily, this is marked as a `Template` so you can simply [Use This Template][use-this] yourself without having to install any tools and dependencies via Terminal, that is Command Prompt on Windows. You will want to follow this generic pattern:

1. First, you will have to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already. [GitHub's Learning Lab][learning-lab] is a good source of information. Sign in to GitHub using your credentials, otherwise.
2. Next, [Use This Template][use-this] to create a copy of this repo, then follow the instructions. Read more about this in the [GitHub Template Repositories][template-repos] document.

That's it. You now have a *cunning stunning stunt kite*, and is ready to start working locally or on the cloud.

[use-this]: /generate
[learning-lab]: https://lab.github.com/

## Stu Chews Shoes

If you are completely new to markdown, [cheat sheet][markdown-cheat-sheet] from Markdown Guide is a good source to *stu chews shoes*.

To start creating your own content, you will want a content authoring tool, that is a markdown editor.

- Typically, this can be done directly on the GitHub repo itself, but
- [Prose][prose] is a much better web-based simple markdown editor with seemless integration to GitHub, or
- Use [GitHub Codespaces][github-codespaces] for a fully blown customizations. To test your site before publishing, press `F1` and run task `live-serve`. This starts a Jekyll server and generate your static site. You should see the content in your favorite browser at [localhost:8004](http://localhost:8004).
